# Book_to_scrape

This code was created as part of project 2, Python Developer course from Open Classroom.

The goal was to create a code to extract information from the website https://books.toscrape.com/.

So, I wrote a code which visits this page and extracts the following information:

product_page_url, universal_ product_code (upc), title, price_including_tax, price_excluding_tax, number_available, product_description, category, review_rating, image_url

At the end of Scrape_books.py I imported all the information collected to a separate CSV for each book category.

And as an extension of the work done, I wrote a new code (Scrape_Books_Images.py) to download and save all the images of the books available on the site.
